# Welcome to the Amiibo Database
I have uploaded every Amiibo .Bin and .NFC file I could get my hands on.
I have **NOT** tested all of these but I have tested *most*, so please let me know if there is a problem.

## My Process:
I typically grab the .NFC from the physical Amiibo when I purchase it. I then convert the .NFC to a .Bin file to have just in case. If I discover a .Bin file, I can convert it to a .NFC as well.
